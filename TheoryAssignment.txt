1.What are various ways to add images into our App?Explain with code examples.
->i)Using img tag:
<img src="https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png" alt="React Image" />
where src takes the value of the URL or path of the image
alt an alternative text in case if image doesnt load
ii)setting background image:

export default function App() {

import reactLogo from './reactLogo.png';
export default function App() {
  return <div style={{ backgroundImage: reactLogo }}>Overlay text</div>

5.What is the difference betwen Client side routing and server side routing?
->server sides needs to keep making requests to the server in order for the application to rerender, 
but client side does not need to keep make request to the server, 
it just does it once when the application is being loaded into the browser 
any other navigation or page change is just being rendered from the already saved application.
