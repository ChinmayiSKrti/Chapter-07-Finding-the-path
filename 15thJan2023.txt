1.useEffect(() => {}) -> without dependency array useEffect is called after each render,
as its not dependent on anything.

2.Never create a component inside a component - Why?
->Because everytime the outer component is rendered inner component is created

3.Never create state inside if else - Why?
->Might create inconsistency; React likes to keep things straight forward in this case,
it wants to know what all are the states at any point in time 

4.Never create state inside for loop - Why?
->for every ith values its not feasible to create states,
because states are created to track state of component, 
having it in one var is only correct

5.Never use state outside functional component
->Because states are are created for the very purpose to be tracked and maintained inside the component,
for tracking the state of that component

6.Can I use more than one useEffect - Yes

7.Why cdn is a greate place to store images?
->

8.Images are already optimized when we put it on to cdn
as we cant optimize it once it comes to browser

9.Shimmer created with help of : 
Array(10).fill("").map((e) => {<div className="shimmer-card"></div>}) - quick way to create shimmer
Note: No need for packages(react-shimmer) for small things that can be done with min effort for many reasons
You can use packages for bigger tasks which involves lots of things like forms - formik

10.React router packages for routing - using latest version i.e version 6

11.We need to create routing configuration inorder for router to work

12.createBrowserRouter is what we use to specify what to load for which path(creating routes)

13.RouterProvider is a component that is used to provide the routes defined to our components

14.errorElement to show error on page for wrong paths

15.useRouteError - Hook used to get error info

16.SPA - Single Page Application - Single Page is loaded once, only content is changed on that same page.

17.<a> tag reloads the page which is opposite to SPA

18.Client side routing: app doesnt load, doesnt make network call to get other pages
Server side routing: all pages come from server

19.Since <a></a> results in page reload, we use <Link></Link>,
but behind the scene <Link></Link> uses <a></a>

20.<Outlet/> - fills whichever children component needs to be loaded depending on route

21.Dynamic Routing:

22.useParams : hook to read params from url

23.Build Login page with hardcoded values on clicking to login it should take to home page(use formik)

24.sequence does not matter inside route configuration

25.modular, maintainable, testable, reusable, readable

26.Pending : fix No restaurant matched your filter
